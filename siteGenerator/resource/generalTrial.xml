<h1>Trial</h1>


<p>
The central object of the application, which contains all information of ...

<br/>
It is possible to deactivate a trial site, with the following implications:
</p>

<h2>Trial status</h2>
<p>
In RANDI2 a trial has different statuses with different effects:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>In Preparation</dt>
	<dd>It is possible to change the structure of the trial, but the randomization is not allowed.</dd>
	<dt>Active</dt>
	<dd>Users with the role investigator can randomize, and the principle Investigator/trial administrator can add new users to the trial or change the status to paused/finished.</dd>
		<dt>Paused</dt>
	<dd>The principle Investigators/trial administrators can add new users to the trial or change the status to active/finished, but it is not allowed to randomize patients.</dd>
		<dt>Finished</dt>
	<dd>No changes are allowed and users (principle investigator/trial administrator/monitor/statistician) can view and export (CSV format) the randomized patients.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Open or closed trial</h2>
<p>
In RANDI2 to it is also possible to define open or closed trials. Open means that it is possible to new participating trial sites during the course of the study.
</p>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>

<p>
A trial contains the following properties:
